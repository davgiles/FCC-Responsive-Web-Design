            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font,
                color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
                decorative features.</p>

        <section id="Syntax" class="main-section">
            <header>Syntax</header>
            <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied
                to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.</p>
            <p>For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be shown as large red text. The
                following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>
            <code>h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 5em;
}</code>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector. This selects the HTML element that we are
                    going to style. In this case, we are styling level one headings (h1).
                </li>
                <li>
                    We then have a set of curly braces { }.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs.
                    We specify the property (color in the above example) before the colon, and we specify the value of
                    the property after the colon (red in this example).
                </li>
                <li>
                    This example contains two declarations, one for color and the other for font-size. Each pair
                    specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting (h1 in this case), then a value that we'd
                    like to give the property.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section id="Adding_CSS_to_our_document" class="main-section">
            <header>Adding CSS to our document</header>
            <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension
                shows that this is a CSS file.</p>
            <p>To link styles.css to index.html, add the following line somewhere inside the &lt;head&gt; of the HTML
                document:</p>
            <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /&gt;</code>
        </section>
        <section id="Styling_HTML_elements" class="main-section">
            <header>Styling HTML elements</header>
            <p>By making our heading red, we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element. We
                do this by targeting an element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element
                name. To target all paragraphs in the document, you would use the selector p. To turn all paragraphs
                green, you would use:</p>
            <code>p {
  color: green;
}</code>
            <p>You can target multiple selectors at the same time by separating the selectors with a comma. If you want
                all paragraphs and all list items to be green, your rule would look like this:</p>
            <code>p,
li {
  color: green;
}</code>
        </section>
        <section id="Adding_a_class" class="main-section">
            <header>Adding a class</header>
            <p>So far, we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This works as long as you want all of
                the elements of that type in your document to look the same. To select a subset of the elements without
                changing the others, you can add a class to your HTML element and target that class in your CSS.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list item. Your list will now look like
                    this:</li>
                <code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Item one&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class="special"&gt;Item two&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Item &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code>
                <li>In your CSS, you can target the class of special by creating a selector that starts with a full stop
                    character. Add the following to your CSS file:</li>
                <code>.special {
  color: orange;
  font-weight: bold;
}</code>
            </ol>

        <section id="Using_selectors" class="main-section">
            <header>Using selectors</header>
            <p>There are times when you will want something to look different based on where it is in the document.
                There are a number of selectors that can help you here, but for now we will look at just a couple. In
                our document, there are two &lt;em&gt; elements — one inside a paragraph and the other inside a list
                item. To select only an &lt;em&gt; that is nested inside an &lt;li&gt; element, you can use a selector
                called the descendant combinator, which takes the form of a space between two other selectors.</p>
            <p>Add the following rule to your stylesheet:</p>
            <code>li em {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}</code>
            <p>This selector will select any &lt;em&gt; element that is inside (a descendant of) an &lt;li&gt;. So in
                your example document, you should find that the &lt;em&gt; in the third list item is now purple, but the
                one inside the paragraph is unchanged.</p>
